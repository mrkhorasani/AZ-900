**Cloud computing** is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. 

**Federal Chief Information Officer of the United States says,** There was a time when every household, town, farm, or village had its water well. Today, shared public utilities give us access to clean water by simply turning on the tap; cloud computing works similarly. Just like water from the tap in your kitchen, cloud computing services can be turned on or off quickly as needed. Like at the water company, there is a team of dedicated professionals making sure the service provided is safe, secure, and available on a 24/7 basis. When the tap isn't on, not only are you saving water, but also you aren't paying for resources you don't currently need.
